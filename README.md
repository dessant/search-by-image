## Description

Search by Image is a browser extension that makes effortless reverse image
searches possible, and comes with support for more than 30 search engines.

The extension helps journalists and researchers verify the authenticity
of images, and assists in the identification of false information
on social media. Search by Image is also popular among photographers,
helping artists explore how their work is shared on the web, while shoppers
find it valuable for discovering similar products at discounted prices.

#### Search Engines

A diverse set of reverse image search engines are supported,
which can be toggled and reordered from the extension's options.
Visit the wiki for the full list of supported search engines.

#### Search Modes

Images positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were
embedded in the page. The extension also supports searching with images
from your device, images from private sites, and captured areas of the page.

A handful of search modes are offered that serve different use cases.
The search mode can be set independently for the context menu
and the browser toolbar from the extension's options.

- **Select URL**: select an image on the page and search with the image URL.
  This is the default search mode.
- **Select image**: select an image on the page and search with the image file.
  This search mode is preferred for sites which do not allow the direct linking
  of images, such as private sites.
- **Capture**: search with a captured area of the page.
- **Browse**: search with an image from your device. Pasting images
  from the clipboard is also supported.
- **URL**: search with an image URL.
